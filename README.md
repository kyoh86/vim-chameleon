# ðŸ¦Ž Chameleon

Chameleon (_vim-chameleon_) is a simple Vim/Neovim plugin that automatically
applies the `background` option based on the OS's dark/light mode. It supports
macOS and will supports other major platforms, including Windows, and Linux.

## Installation

Install [Deno](https://deno.land), then use
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) or your favorite Vim plugin
manager to install it as follows:

```vim
Plug 'vim-denops/denops.vim'
Plug 'lambdalisue/vim-chameleon'
```

## Usage

The plugin automatically detects the OS's dark/light mode every 30 minutes and
adjusts the `background` option accordingly. If you'd like to apply the change
immediately, run the following command:

```vim
:ChameleonApply
```

To disable the plugin, run:

```vim
:ChameleonDisable
```

To re-enable it, run:

```vim
:ChameleonEnable
```

You can modify the interval for checking changes by setting
`g:chameleon_interval` in your `vimrc`:

```vim
" Check every 5 minutes
let g:chameleon_interval = 5 * 60 * 1000
```

To disable automatic detection on startup, use the
`g:chameleon_disable_on_startup` option:

```vim
let g:chameleon_disable_on_startup = 1
```

To execute commands when the background changes, use the
`ChameleonBackgroundChanged:{background}` autocommand. For example, to change
the `colorscheme`:

```vim
augroup chameleon
  autocmd!
  autocmd User ChameleonBackgroundChanged:light colorscheme dawnfox
  autocmd User ChameleonBackgroundChanged:dark colorscheme nordfox
augroup END
```

This configuration switches the colorscheme to `dawnfox` when the background is
light and to `nordfox` when it is dark. You can find these colorschemes at
[EdenEast/nightfox.nvim](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim).
